          Hi, I'm Jorge, a software engineer with a masterâ€™s degree in
          Computational Mechanics, where I developed a strong foundation in
          Applied Mathematics, Numerical Methods, Computational Modeling &
          Simulation, and Software Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience spans developing front-end and back-end systems,
          including building scalable web applications using Angular, Node.js,
          PostgreSQL, and InfluxDB. I have worked on projects that range from
          creating human-machine interfaces (HMI) for industrial automation to
          conducting R&D in AI-driven robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am focused on applying my mathematical and programming
          expertise to quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, fintech and
          web technologies. where I aim to contribute by developing robust,
          high-performance models and software solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I have experience in PLC software development, contributing to
          innovative automated production systems and AI-based robotics
          applications.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Now, I'm looking to transition into web and web3 development to
          leverage my skills in creating robust, scalable web applications.
